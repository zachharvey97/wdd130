    <p>Hi everyone, I'm your resident nerd. I'm a big fan of anime, video games, board games, and other nerdy things 
        like Dungeons and Dragons. I'm from Massachusetts, and I am really sad that I am missing all the leaves on trees start to 
        turn colors. I really love Fall because of how pretty it is, but I am happy to be somewhere a bit warmer.</p>
    <p>I am a senior studying Business Operations for my major, have completed a finance minor, and am now working towards a Business
        Analytics minor. I programmed a purchasing system for my internship and found it a blast so I wanted to learn a bit more about 
        how programming could be used in my career moving forward. </p>
    <p>I am looking forward to working together with everyone in class and hope we all have fun! </p>
