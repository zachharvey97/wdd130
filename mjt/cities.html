            Tokyo

        <p>
            Tokyo is one of the world's liveliest cities, full of amazing restaurants, beautiful gardens, stunning modern architecture, 
            charming backstreets, and a glittering neon-filled cityscape. Beyond the city lights and crowds, Tokyo is also full of quiet 
            neighborhoods where you'll find locals going about their daily lives, and countless hidden gems in the form of unsung yet 
            wonderful little shops and restaurants. <br>
            <br>
            Explore charming neighborhoods such as (for example) Aoyama, Daikanyama, Naka-Meguro, and Shimokitazawa. You can also 
            more peaceful museums, shrines, or gardens such as the Nezu Museum, Meiji Jingu Shrine, and Hamarikyu Garden. <br>
            <br>
            In a city with so much to offer, there is no way you will have time to see, do, and eat everything on your wish list. 
            But don't lose hope! Because with even just one day in Tokyo, you can get beneath the surface and experience Tokyo like few 
            travelers ever will.

            Kyoto
        </h2>
        <img class= 'cityimg' src="images/cities-kyoto.jpeg" alt="Kyoto Cityscape">
        <p>
            Kyoto is what many travelers envision when they think of Japan, but along with being the country's spiritual heart and 
            cultural soul, what is Kyoto known for? The ancient capital's highlights include World Heritage temples and shrines, 
            historic gardens, generations-old shops and restaurants, and picturesque backstreets. <br>
            <br>
            Having served as the capital of Japan for over a thousand years, the name “Kyoto” literally translates as “capital city.” 
            Today, the old capital is a large, modern city with a population of over one million, yet in many ways still manages to 
            retain the elegance and traditions of its past. <br>
            <br>
            The city's appeal doesn't just lie in the past, though. One of the ten largest cities in Japan, Kyoto is also a hotbed of 
            creativity and modernity. From hip new cafes to art galleries and small boutiques run by the coolest young designers, Kyoto 
            continues to be at the forefront of Japanese culture and one of the world's most rewarding destinations.

            Osaka

        <img class= 'cityimg' src="images/cities-osaka.jpeg" alt="Osaka Cityscape">
        <p>
            The lively metropolis of Osaka, Kansai's largest city, is sometimes overlooked by first-time visitors to Japan (usually in favor of 
            Kyoto, which always appears on lists of Japan's best destinations). Yet it is a favorite of Japan connoisseurs and repeat visitors, 
            especially among travelers who love Japanese food. <br>
            <br>
            Osaka is best known for its amazing casual food and outgoing locals. It's arguably Japan's street food capital, and most famous for 
            snacks including takoyaki and okonomiyaki. Osaka is also renowned for its fun, extroverted people who make eating and drinking in 
            the city an unforgettable experience.
